1. The name of your validator
Kayrosstack

2. Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne
We are delegators on cosmos hub and are deeply conserned by the idea of shared security. 
We are alined with the consitution of atomone and understand that the importance of Atom before prop 848 was to be essentially a staking token and garentee of security. 
It would have been better if the proposal had been discussed for more time and we think that it was adopted with a small majority comparing to the importance of the topic. 
For all the above and because we think that our ideas can be bettre defended if we participate as a validator to the govgen and the atomone projects.

3. Brief history/ Intro to your validator 
We are two individual validator working in QA and testing activites. We are thrilled to be the quality validator.
Becoming a validator on this project is a way for us, individual and independent delegators on the Cosmos Hub, to become more active in the ecosystem.
