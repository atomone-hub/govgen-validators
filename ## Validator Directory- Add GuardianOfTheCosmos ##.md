## Validator Directory: GuardianOfTheCosmos

1) The name of your validator

- GuardianOfTheCosmos

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

- Since the inception of Cosmos in 2016, I have been an ardent supporter of Jae Kwon's pioneering vision for a secure and interconnected blockchain ecosystem. My journey with Cosmos began with the ICO, and I have actively participated in staking to contribute to the network's resilience and growth. The passage of Proposition 848, which shifted the network's focus towards monetary gains at the expense of its foundational security principles, deeply concerned me. This event rekindled my commitment to the original ethos of Cosmos, prompting my active participation in the townhalls. My aspiration to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne stems from a profound belief in restoring and advancing Jae's foundational vision. By serving as a validator, I aim to champion the principles of decentralization, security, and community-driven governance that are at the heart of Atom1. My involvement as a new validator (in addition to the well established validators) would not only support these ideals but also contribute to a more inclusive and diverse validator community, reinforcing the network's strength and integrity.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

-While I may not have previous experience running a validator node on the Cosmos Hub, my journey with Cosmos dates back to its very beginning in 2016. This longstanding engagement has endowed me with a deep understanding of the network's evolution, challenges, and achievements. Inspired by Atom1's mission. My commitment to the Atom1 community and its goals drives me to establish a robust validator node. I believe that diversifying the validator pool with new, motivated entrants like myself is crucial for the network's resilience and progress. I am ready to leverage my experience, dedication, and the collective wisdom of the Atom1 community to enhance network security, foster innovation, and uphold the decentralized ethos we all value in alignment with Atom1's vision of a secure, decentralized, and community-governed inter blockchain ecosystem.
