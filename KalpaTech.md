## Validator Directory: KalpaTech

1) The name of your validator

- KalpaTech

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

- Our team is interested in becoming a validator for GovGen and AtomOne, driven by a commitment to the project's vision of providing an alternative fork alongside Gaia to address divergent views within the Cosmos community. We have voted NWV on prop 82 and NO on prop 848 as we believe that these proposals do not coincide with Cosmos Hub’s vision and direction. We align with AtomOne's focus on sovereignty, security, and decentralization, recognizing the need for a diverse and adaptive multichain ecosystem.
Having been longstanding contributors to the Cosmos ecosystem, our team is committed to the success of both Cosmos Hub and AtomOne. We anticipate that the alternative decisions made by the AtomOne community will contribute significantly to the growth of both networks. As a validator, we are dedicated to guiding Cosmos Hub towards safe implementations through intelligent decisions done by the GovGen and the AtomOne community and leveraging $ATOMs as a voting bloc in the Cosmos network.
AtomOne's role as a minimal IBC/ICS hub also resonates with our commitment to minimizing risk and ensuring chain’s security. We endorse conservative hub functions while also supporting experimentation through new forks or splits. 
In summary, we are supportive of the project’s vision and objectives, ready to contribute as validators to the growth, innovation, and decentralization of the Cosmos ecosystem.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

- The Kalpatech team, a longstanding active contributor and validator within the Cosmos community since 2017, has played an important community role in the ecosystem over the past six years. Celebrating the 5-year milestone since actively engaging as a validator on Cosmos Hub, marked by being one of the awarded winners of Game of Stakes, we have consistently enhanced KalpaTech's validation infrastructure and developed valuable tools, such as the Governance notification tool for Cosmos chains. Our self-funded initiatives and expertise have contributed significantly to the broader Cosmos community.
With a proud record of no slashing incidents since inception, we have focused on validating, monitoring, and fortifying our infrastructure for optimal security. Currently providing validator services for 25 Cosmos projects, we have closely followed and supported various ecosystem launches. Find more about us at [kalpatech.co](https://kalpatech.co)
