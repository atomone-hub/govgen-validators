2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

We are passionate about becoming a validator for GovNo and AtomOne to help realize the original vision of Cosmos, as envisioned by Jae Kwon. We believe that Atom One as a minimalist and security-oriented network proposes a unique vision worth bringing to market, and that the proposed alternative solution to the current governance architecture is potentially a very effective way to achieve this goal.

By participating in this initiative, we hope to contribute to the growth of a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem that benefits the entire community. Given the time that has passed since the original idea was put forth, we find the alternative solution to the current governance architecture to be effective in addressing the concerns of the Cosmos community which align closely to the core tenets proposed by the originators of GovNo and Atom One.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

Oni Validator has been active in Cosmos since 2022 when we launched our first node. Weâ€™ve since expanded our operations to validating 20 networks and growing. We are 100% slashing protected and have had no such incident. We proudly serve over 21K clients around the world and have $20MM+ assets under management. We regularly communicate with and provide consulting for protocols on development and other insights. Moreover, we take serious consideration of our delegators and seek to align ourselves with long-term thinkers in the Cosmos ecosystem.
