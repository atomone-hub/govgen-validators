## Validator Directory: Onbloc

1. The name of your validator:
- Onbloc Node

2. Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne:
- Onblocâ€™s team members have been long followers of the Cosmos Ecosystem from its inception. CSO Peter worked on [Lunamint](https://medium.com/lunamint-atlas/introducing-lunagram-a-cosmos-wallet-inside-telegram-messenger-35135168f0d5) (Wallet & Validator) with the support of AiB/ICF in the early days of Cosmos. As supporters of the original vision of Cosmos (as blueprinted the original [Cosmos Token Model paper](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos/blob/0141bbcdbf68a784348ba059096f8238c696f9a8/Cosmos_Token_Model.pdf)), we believe that the focal point of the Cosmos Hub is to serve as a secure and minimal ICS/IBC token Hub that requires the highest level of security.
    >"Because the Cosmos Hub is responsible for the operation and consensus of many chains, the security and crypto-economic design of the Hub is of paramount importance." (Page 2, Line 86)

    >"... model in which the Atom, is used primarily only for staking, and is not intended to be used to pay fees or used as a currency." (Page 4, Line 162)

- However, Onbloc has identified a series of harmful proposals submitted to the Cosmos Hub which could potentially lead to its existential crisis.
  - [Proposal #69](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/69): An attempt to add the CosmWasm VM.
  - [Proposal #82](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/82): An attempt to arbitrarily change the tokenomics of $ATOM and the positioning of the Hub.
  - [Proposal #848](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/848): An attempt to forcefully lower the inflation parameters, undermining the proven security of the Hub.
- Onbloc recognizes the need for an alternative fork of the Cosmos Hub, one that will serve as a Minimal IBC/ICS Hub, which was the original vision of Cosmos. This secure yet powerful hub will synergize with innovative ICS chains. One such chain is Gno.land, a project in which Onbloc is one of the most active contributors. Therefore, Onbloc deeply resonates with the vision of AtomOne and is committed to providing active support.

3. Brief history/ Intro to your validator:
- Onbloc has been operating a validator node on the Cosmos Hub since October 2022 and is now validating the Cosmos Hub, Teritori Network, Neutron (ICS), and Stride (ICS). To maintain the highest possible uptime and governance participation rate, Onbloc is proactive in upgrades and changes, actively monitoring all communication channels to address any issues or updates while strictly following guidance. Additionally, we are running our own node for Gno.land testnets and indexing blockchain data for our public services such as [Adena Wallet](https://adena.app/) and [GnoScan Block Explorer](https://gnoscan.io/). We will also take part in the Multi-Validator testnet initiative in the Gno.land project."

In order for the application to be approved by the community, all AtomOne/GovNo Validators:

7. Must replicate, understand, and validate the genesis distribution. (See atomone-hub/genesis#65 (review))
- I acknowledge. I will make sure we go through the validation process of the genesis distribution.

8. Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it by contributing to the code or creating a PR/PRs.
- We will make a PR soon.

9. Must adhere to a global decentralization mandate and if required to cooperate in translation for an efficient global reach.
- I acknowledge. We'll adhere to the mandate and provide traslation for the locals whenever needed. As part of this effort, we made a Korean translation of STAKING_VS_MONEY.md (https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/pull/104).

10. Must contribute to build a fair validators distribution structure by building guidelines to include tiers, participation levels, and validators limitations and operating conditions.
- I acknowledge. 

11. Must provide Transparency disclosures of associations among validators. (Also see Validators and KYC #75). The AtomOne Community will put together best practices for KYC-ing and approving validator submissions. The conversation can be followed here: (Validators and KYC #75)
- I acknowledge.
