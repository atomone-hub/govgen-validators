###Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne
The principle of hub minimalism, as exemplified by the AtomOne fork, is more than a technical strategy; it's a philosophical stance on what blockchain technology should stand for—security, efficiency, and the empowerment of individual sovereignty. As the Cosmos Hub moves forward with this vision, it sets a precedent for other projects in the space, highlighting the importance of core principles in the face of rapid technological advancement and complexity.
Our aspiration to become a validator for AtomOne reflects a commitment to the foundational principles of blockchain technology: decentralization, security, and efficient governance. As validators play a critical role in the integrity and operation of blockchain networks, our participation can significantly impact the Cosmos community.

Our commitment to global decentralization through facilitating effective communication and outreach within diverse communities, particularly through efforts like collaborating on Chinese translations, is commendable and strategically important. Language barriers can significantly hinder the adoption and understanding of blockchain technology, and by addressing these barriers, you're not only expanding the accessibility of information but also fostering inclusivity within the blockchain ecosystem.

###Must provide Transparency disclosures of associations among validators. (Also see Validators and KYC #75).
Our commitment to upholding transparency by disclosing any associations or affiliations with other validators is a crucial step towards ensuring openness and integrity within the network. This approach fosters trust among network participants, including users, developers, and other validators. 

The Community will put together best practices for KYC-ing and approving validator submissions. The conversation can be followed here: (Validators and KYC #75))
We will comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements and actively participate in discussions for establishing best practices for validating submissions is a commendable approach.
