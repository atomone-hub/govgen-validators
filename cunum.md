## Validator Directory: cunum

1) The name of your validator

- cunum

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

- I'm a supporter of the cause, voted 'no' on prop #848 because I don't see a future in a Hub that doesn't max out on security for ICS and I see ICS as a crucial component for the success of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. I always wanted to validate for a Cosmos appchain but never dared because of the intimidating cartel-like structures in the ecosystem. I'm hoping this will be a thing of the past with the new compensation mechanics of AtomOne, by getting rid of the commission based system, finally bringing more decentralization to the Cosmos ecosystem.
