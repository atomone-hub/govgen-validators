## Validator Directory: cunum

1) The name of your validator

- cunum

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

- I'm a supporter of the cause, voted 'NO' on #848 because I don't see a future in a Hub that doesn't max out on security for ICS. Always wanted to validate for a Cosmos appchain but never dared because of the intimidating cartel-like structure in the ecosystem. Hoping this will be a thing of the past with the new compensation mechanics of AtomOne by getting rid of the commission based system, finally bringing more decentralization to the Cosmos ecosystem.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

- I'm a solo validator, validating for NEAR protocol since January 2023, involved in Cosmos ecosystem as user since 2021
