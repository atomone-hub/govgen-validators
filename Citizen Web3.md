## Validator Directory: Citizen Web3

1) The name of your validator

- Citizen Web3

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne

- We believe that decentralization is a superior form of communication stylistics rather than a centralized one. Our choice of the networks we validate (https://www.citizenweb3.com/staking) follows that goal. We want to become contributors to the networks that experiment with governance, build decentralized infrastructure, bridges between ecosystems. Both networks in our opinion fall into the first category heavily. Such a powerful network as Atom, is the building essence of a decentralized community. If blockchains are to be viewed as digital nations, atom is certainly a blue chip. We believe that by contributing to such a network, we help society to achieve the goal of decentralization.

9) Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it by contributing to the code or creating a PR/PRs

- Citizen Web3 participated actively during the first(?)/last round table call and was the first to post a review of it on Twitter. We are also trying to participate by leaving some constructive criticism on issues in the repos on the project. 

10) Must adhere to a global decentralization mandate and if required to cooperate in translation for an efficient global reach

- We run the Citizen Web3 podcast. Its a 4 year old, educational podcast about the people that build web3. The main message of the podcast is just that: global decentralization mandate. Unbank the banked. Here is one of our latest episodes to show our dedication to that mission: https://www.citizenweb3.com/derekwills
We invited a libertarian author on purpose to help spread these messages to web3 builders and founders! 

11) Must contribute to build a fair validators distribution structure by building guidelines to include tiers, participation levels, and validators limitations and operating conditions

- We are not associated with any other validator that opened a PR, nor with any other validator directly. However, Citizen Web3 holds (dust) DAO stakes in some other validators, such as the Posthuman or Kleomedes DAO
