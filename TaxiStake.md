1. Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne?
    
    1. TaxiStake manages the [ShapeShift DAO](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/validators/cosmosvaloper199mlc7fr6ll5t54w7tts7f4s0cvnqgc59nmuxf) and TaxiStake validators within the Cosmos ecosystem. ShapeShift DAO voted NO on proposal 848. AtomOne's focus on sovereignty, security, and decentralization is significant. As validators, we are devoted to fostering a robust and inclusive decentralized ecosystem. We do not reuse keys, but we can sign a transaction to verify the ownership of the ShapeShift Cosmos validator.
