Validator Application - AtomOne

## Validator Directory: Michael Frasinelli / Frasinelli Systems

1) The name of your validator

- Gold Raven
  
2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

I strongly believe in the importance of security above all else on the hub, providing a stable foundation for endless chains and projects to build on top of it. Everything in my background points towards the separation of monetary aspects and governance/staking aspects being a core element of long term sustainability. 

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

I previously ran validator nodes for Polygon, FLUX, and dozens for Presearch. I still actively run L7 Litecoin miners which are set up to maximize profit through the mining of whatever compatible coin is most profitable at the time, before ultimately converting it back into LTC.

10) Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it by contributing to the code or creating a PR/PRs

  - See GovGen and AtomOne distribution conversations under multiple GitHub issues. Built a full AtomOne distribution analysis dashboard to assist in that eventual community decision (multiplier amounts, % that each proposal impacts weighting, etc).

11) Must adhere to a global decentralization mandate and if required to cooperate in translation for an efficient global reach

  - Decentralization is one of the main values of CrowdControl. We adhere to it. Furthermore we are capable of writing [high quality articles](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-ultimate-cosmos-delegation-guide-for-real-idiots-87ebc6518145) for an efficient global reach

12) Must provide Transparency disclosures of associations among validators. (Also see [Validators and KYC #75](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094)).

  - Noted

13) The Community will put together best practices for KYC-ing and approving validator submissions. The conversation can be followed here: ([Validators and KYC #75)](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094))

I am more than happy to participate in any future KYC requirements beyond this initial application.
