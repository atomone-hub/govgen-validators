2. Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne:
NodeHub is a new member of COSMOS VALIDATOR. We currently only have one VALIDATOR, Teritori, but we have been deeply involved in the Cosmos ecosystem for many years. We are also Atom holders. Team DEV has experience in Node construction and operation and maintenance. We want to be a validator for Govno and Atomone for several reasons:

Technical expertise and experience: As mentioned above, although we are a new value, the team DEV members have previously had a verification of more than many projects in other communities, and they have been established and played an important role in the ecosystem for a long time. This enables us to effectively manage and maintain the verification node of Govno and Atomone. We can respond quickly, because team members have different jet lag, which can be online.

Community participation and influence: We mainly have a large number of community members in the Chinese community WeChat channel. NodeHub Validator's main goal this year is to increase community influence.

Contributions to the ecosystem: become the verified by Govno and Atomone, which means that we will be able to directly participate in the operation and development of the COSMOS ecosystem. Because our team has the front -end back -end DEV. As a verification person, we can contribute to the security and stability of the network. At the same time, we can participate in the governance and decision -making process of the ecosystem and promote the development and growth of the ecosystem.

Sustainable development and growth: The verifications of Govno and Atomone will keep us closely related to the COSMOS ecosystem and provide opportunities to participate in new projects and development. This will help us continue to develop and develop, and continue to improve the technical level and knowledge foundation in the fields of blockchain and distributed systems.
