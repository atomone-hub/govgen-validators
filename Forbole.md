## Validator Directory: Forbole

1) The name of your validator

- Forbole

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

- Forbole has voted `No with Veto` to proposal #82 and `No` to proposal #848 as we believe those proposals do not align with the original idea of Cosmos and would not achieve what the proposals have illustrated. Hence, we would like to join GovNo and AtomOne to contritubte to the community to see if we can start work out some experience to achieve something together.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

- Forbole was established in 2017 in Hong Kong by [Kwun Yeung](https://twitter.com/kwunyeung) and [Terence Lam](https://twitter.com/terencesflam). We first started the company to study Proof of Stake networks and aimed to develop a Decentralized Social Network. After learning about `Tendermint Core`, `Cosmos SDK` and the concept of `Cosmos` in late 2017, we deceided to develop the network using `Cosmos SDK` as we agreed on the vision of `Internet of Blockchain`. We would like to see it happen and be involved in this movement. As the SDK was not ready yet, we jumped into the validator chat room on Riot in early 2018 and started our journey of being a validator.
- While we were working with the community on making `Cosmos`, we developed [Big Dipper](https://bigdipper.live), which is the fully open source block explorer for `Cosmos`. `Big Dipper` has become a suite made up of a chain indexer, GraphQL middleware and a frontend application.
- We were one of the winners in `Game of Stakes` and became one of the genesis validators of `Cosmos Hub`. Since then, we keep investing in our infrastructure and contribute to different projects and ecosystems. Besides `Cosmos Hub`, we are also a validator on many of the Cosmos chains including `Akash`, `Osmosis`, `Celestia`, `dYdX`, etc and other ecosystems like `Solana`, `Sui`, `Oasis`, `Radix`. We are also one of the 19 guardians in `Wormhole` and running the Cosmos-based `Wormhole Gateway`. Recently, we contiue to expand our footprint in `Ethereum` by being a node operator for ETH staking.
- Forbole is also the developing team of [`Desmos`](https://github.com/desmos-labs/desmos), a Decentralized Social Network built with `Cosmos SDK`. By being a validator and developer of a protocol, we gain extensive knowledge on the SDK. With our contributions to the SDK, Big Dipper and supports in the community, we ranked 2nd in the first round of the ICF ATOM delegation in 2023.

8) Must replicate, understand, and validate the genesis distribution. (See https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/pull/65#pullrequestreview-1775992431)

9) Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it by contributing to the code or creating a PR/PRs

10) Must adhere to a global decentralization mandate and if required to cooperate in translation for an efficient global reach

- Although we started in Hong Kong, teammates of Forbole are located around the globe with different genders, ethnic groups and cultures. We speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian. Besides the above requirements on validating the genesis, we can contribute by translating the mandate and distribute them via our social channels.

11) Must contribute to build a fair validators distribution structure by building guidelines to include tiers, participation levels, and validators limitations and operating conditions

- We have been involved in the distribution structure since the launch of `Cosmos Hub`. We were active on the Cosmos Forum and Twitter expressing our views on voting power distributon and incentive mechanisms in the early days.

12) Must provide Transparency disclosures of associations among validators. (Also see [Validators and KYC #75](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094)). The AtomOne Community will put together best practices for KYC-ing and approving validator submissions. The conversation can be followed here: ([Validators and KYC #75)](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094))

- KYC is always a tricky part in a decentralized network. Forbole has been KYC'ed by ICF during the `Games of Stakes`. For a more decentralized solution, we would suggest to adapt `Desmos` as a way of verifying an identity. The core feature of `Desmos` is `Desoms Profile`, which is a decentralized profile by verifying the ownerships of public social identities. It is going to adapt DID representations with cross-chain supports. Here is an example https://bigdipper.live/cosmos/@forbole .
