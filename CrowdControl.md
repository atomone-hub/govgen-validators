## Validator Directory: CrowdControl

1) The name of your validator

- CrowdControl

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

We strongly support the proposal to fork the Cosmos Hub into AtomOne. We firmly believe that this action will enhance governance alignment for both chains, fostering their ability to thrive in the future. As a gaming project, CrowdControl aims to represent the gaming community within the cosmos. Consequently, we are equally committed to doing so within AtomOne.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

CrowdControl is a development DAO that is creating a trading card game that gives their community full ownership of their cards and full ownership of the game. In 2021 CrowdControl won [HackAtom VI](https://hackatom.org/) in the category gaming and is following their vision to bring gaming to the cosmos since then. We currently released a [unity/c# integration for cosmos.](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/8971) In 2022 a part of CrowdControl started their own Osmosis and Cosmos Validator under the same brand and were able to score [2nd place in the Game of Chains](https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022) incentivized testnet.
