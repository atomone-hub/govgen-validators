## Validator Directory: Interchain.FM

The name of your validator:

- Interchain.FM (iFM)

Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne:

- We want to support and maintain the cultural backbone of Cosmos, preserving the social contract for many who bought into the original vision and doing so without compromising utility. There's enough room in Cosmos for different implementations of the multichain thesis, with Atom One being one such variant. We believe that in participating in AtomOne, that we can drive critical initiatives that will have lasting impact for the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem.

Brief history/ Intro to your validator:

- Chjango has been a long-time steward of the Cosmos Network since before day 0. We started iFM validator in 2022 as a complementary thing to our podcast that was started from within Tendermint in late 2019. Our validator is operated in partnership with RockX, an institutional-grade staking provider based out of Singapore. Since then, we've run validators for Osmosis, Cosmos Hub, Umee, Canto, and Comdex with future planned support for Celestia, various other appchains, as well as parallel VM chains.
