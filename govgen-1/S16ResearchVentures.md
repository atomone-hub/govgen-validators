1. The name of your validator

S16 Research Ventures

2. Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne

We are very interested in the Atom One experiment, especially in regards to the idea of photons and containers (similar to Amazon Web Services).

We voted No with Veto for Atom 2.0 as we see large risks involved in some of its central bank related concepts.

We voted Yes for Prop 848 since Atom has continued struggle in finding product-market fit and change seem like the better of two risky options.

We are reinvigorated by the recent town hall meeting by the GovGen community and the vision put forth and communicated by Jae Kwon.

We have been involved in the Cosmos Hub since the Genesis block and hope to continue to support Jae Kwon’s vision through Atom One and GovGen."
