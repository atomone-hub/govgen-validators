Our impact extends beyond validation; we actively enhance the Cosmos ecosystem through technical improvements in Tendermint Core and Cosmos-SDK, emphasizing optimized appchain performance. Additionally, our involvement in trading, showcased by B-Harvest TaaS (Trading As A Service), leverages five years of blockchain research and a team of TradFi experts to offer top-tier trading services for DeFi protocols. Our journey, initiated in 2018 with a DeFi-focused vision, led to the launch of the Crescent Network in April 2022, accompanied by advancements in Tendermint Core features and performance, as well as ongoing exploration of ways to enhance performance for appchains with demanding efficiency and latency criteria.
