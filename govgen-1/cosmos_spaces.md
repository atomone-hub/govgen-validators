3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

Cosmos Spaces started as a community resource to educate and onboard users into the Cosmos in both English and Spanish. After deciding to plant our roots deeper into the ecosystem, we began to run validators and directly support protocols. We now are one of the top relayers in the entire Cosmos ecosystem and provide public and private infrastructure including endpoints, block explorers, and validator onboarding documentation.
