# Validators

**Directory for GovGen and AtomOne Validators**

The GovGen and AtomOne Validators directory is a space to build a registry of GovGen and AtomOne validators for the community. A comprehensive list of validators, with information on who they are and how to get in touch, will make it easier for the validators community to engage directly with one another, coordinate upcoming tasks, and collaborate more efficiently. This directory is also a great space to discuss validated proposals in regard to operating requirements, upcoming issues, implementation ideas, or proposed solutions.

All validators who have voted NO or NWV on CosmosHub proposal #848 are invited to submit their request for participation through a pull request to this repository.

The Validators directory of the AtomOne repo is an initiative to help serve as a guide to:

* make it easier for existing projects, newcomers and community members to identify the approved validators
* for validators to coordinate on upcoming tasks and issues related to their operating activity as well as share valuable resource
* find development synergies and implementations
* make introductions to potential partners
* get plugged into the ecosystem
