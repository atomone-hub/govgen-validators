Our team possesses deep knowledge and experience in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, allowing us to enhance user experiences and develop systems that can scale efficiently.
- We are true believers of decentralized infrastructure and host our servers across multiple data centers across the globe along with Akash cloud and IPFS. At Zenscape, we guarantee scalability and availability for archive nodes and RPC’s. We run relayers, explorers and also create snapshots on a regular basis to enhance our services.
