## Validator Directory: PRO Delegators

1) The name of your validator

	- PRO Delegators

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

We place a strong emphasis on governance, and we have even dedicated a separate entity called "Govmos" to this task. We view GovGen & AtomOne as a credible solution to help address some of the governance challenges the Hub is facing, and therefore, we want to support this initiative. Despite having voted Abstain on Prop#848, we want to provide some context. We have made a promise to our delegators not to vote on their behalf when a divisive vote is taking place, while we put a lot of effort into informing them on the subject so they can cast their own votes. This commitment is a core value of our validation proposition, and we hope that the AtomOne community will recognize it as well and allow us to be part of the validator set.

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

The formation of PRO Delegators is a tale of convergence between three distinct entities. On one side, thereâ€™s Phil_RX, boasting more than a decade of experience in traditional finance, trading-related businesses, and private financial advisory. The second entity is PRO Indicators, an open online community that has been sharing educational content on trading and investing since 2015. Finally, in early 2023, PRO Delegators officially came into existence with the incorporation of Nuxian Labs, a Swiss developer team boasting 13 years of experience in the IT business and 7 years in blockchain development.
