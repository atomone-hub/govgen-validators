## Validator Directory: GATAONE

1) The name of your validator

    GATAONE

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovGen and AtomOne

  -  GATA conservatives (No & NWV voters on 848) are deeply committed to preserve the minimal hub state, irrespective of more experimental approaches. This commitment stems from a desire to safeguard the original vision. Which also would provide us a path we originally committed to for developments and contributions in the original mission.
  -  ATONE distribution allocated to the GATA team, GATA delegation partner, GATA GovGen members, and the treasury in accordance with the snapshot of the 848 votes. Relying solely on staking to secure AtomOne would be suboptimal, as GATA GovGen and the team can assume a more significant role in the validation, governance and safeguarding the conservative interests of the minimal hub.
