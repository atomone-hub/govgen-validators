* We are running validator node since 2020, we have very big experience in cosmsos ecosystem as a genesis validator you can find all the projects on our github page https://github.com/romanv1812.
* We believe that the price of succcess is hard work, and out team is working hard everyday, to expand our set of projects, and we are willing to contribute our time and expeience to support Atom One, i am sure it will be familiar to us because of so big expertise on cosmsos ecosystem.
* We sulport projects not only as a validator but also as a relayer and web3 service provider. And also we believe that old model of Atom have have no long term perspective, and we are excited to support new chain Atom One
